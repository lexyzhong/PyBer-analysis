# PyBer-analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
To analyze and visualize ride-sharing data from PyBer in order to allow for comparisons between city types and identification of areas for improvement.

## Results

* Rural cities have the least total rides, total drivers, and total fares, followed by suburban cities. Urban cities have the highest number of all aforementioned metrics.
* Due to the low demand and supply of rides, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is highest for rural cities, followed by suburban cities, and is lowest for urban cities.

* Although urban cities offered the lowest rates per ride and driver, due to high demand for rides, urban cities generates the most amount of fares (revenue) for PyBer, followed by suburban cities, and rural cities last.

## Summary
To address disparities among city types, PyBer should consider:
1) promoting services to increase demand for rides in rural areas
2) hire more drivers to: a) ensure there are enough drivers to meet ride demand and b) drive down fare costs
3) relocating drivers from urban cities to suburban or rural areas as a lower average fare per driver compared to the average fare per ride in the urban cities suggests that there is an oversupply of drivers in the urban areas
